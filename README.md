# Dog Image Classification Bootcamp Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive exercise to prepare, train, and deploy a machine learning model that classifies dog breeds from images. The project involves using a popular dog breed dataset, setting up a suitable machine learning environment, and deploying the model using FastAPI and Docker.

### Key Activities:
1. **Data Preparation and Augmentation**: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets and applying data augmentation techniques.
2. **Model Training**: Training several deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2) on the prepared data.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluating and selecting the best-performing model based on validation accuracy.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploying the selected model with a FastAPI application, containerized using Docker.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)
- **Description**: The dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world.
